Well, looks like you have:
A) cloned the code because you don't know how to use GitHub
B) wanna browse my code in an IDE
C) editing or compiling the code

If you are here for option A, which are people trying to download
The app not realizing source code is useless without being compiled,
I have a fix for you!

To download the application:
Use discord: https://discord.gg/DVx6DDT2af
You will find the ZIP within announcements
Or
Use GitHub: https://github.com/BTELNYY/yansimsavegameeditor/releases
Discord is easier for people who don't know about GitHub.
