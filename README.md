# yansimsavegameeditor
A program to edit Yandere Simulators save files.
You can edit the code, you can also submit your own edits to this page. I will review them and add them if needed.
If you can optimize my code, I will be thankful.
For the love of god do not go after me over coding practices. Its not like it even effects a CLI.
Report any bugs to me here or on my Discord: btelnyy#8395

DISCLAIMER: I am not resposible for you breaking your save files, I just made the tool.

Patch Notes v1.4 BETA 1
First beta! 
* Fixed typos

Path Notes v1.3
Hi, this is tiny patch as I am working on something bigger for the next one. Enjoy messing around!
* Added "item" command to the config submenu, this command allows you to bring items to school which you normally should not be able to.
* Fixed the kidnap command from last update using wrong arguments making it only work in Ayanos first save slot, it should now work everywhere.
* Added a warning stating that setting debug to be on in 1980's is useless as it supports it by default now. However you still need to beat the game.

Patch Notes v1.2
* Added 'kidnap' command to the npc menu.
 * Allows for changing of the victim to any NPC.
 * Release of a victim.
* Added feedback when a command succeeds.
* Fixed A bug where prompts would not work correctly.

Patch Notes: v1.1
* added Tinker menu, allows for controlled access to your registry by you.
* added revive option in NPC config
* fixed a bug with a error on launch
* re-wrote all of the prompts to be cleaner
* added deletesave menu to delete your registry data
