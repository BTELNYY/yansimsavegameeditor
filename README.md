# Installation Guide
The files extracted from the ZIP folder must go into the same folder as the games EXE, not the launcher directory, but the game directory.
The other 2 files within that ZIP folder are CRITICAL, if you don't have them, it won't work.
If you need additional help or something won't work, contact us [here.](https://discord.gg/P22tFkjTm3)
