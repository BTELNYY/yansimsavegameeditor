# yansimsavegameeditor
A program to edit Yandere Simulators save files.
You can edit the code, you can also submit your own edits to this page. I will review them and add them if needed.
If you can optimize my code, I will be thankful.
For the love of god do not go after me over coding practices. Its not like it even effects a CLI.
Report any bugs to me here or on my Discord: btelnyy#8395

TODO:
* ~~Allow people to change the club they are in.~~
* Replace most if/elseif/else statements with switch cases.
* Add a GUI for the entire app.
* Make most of the commands function based instead of logic based.
* ~~Add configuration via registry~~
* ~~Add a file icon~~ Thanks Fashion :)
* Add the ability to delete keys in the tinkerer
If you can do one of these, do it. Just create a pull request for me to review.
