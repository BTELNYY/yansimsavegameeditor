# yansimsavegameeditor
I program to edit Yandere Simulators save files.
You can edit the code, you can also submit your own edits to this page. I will review them and add them if needed.
If you can optimize my code, I will be thankful.
For the love of god do not go after me over coding practices. Its not like it even effects a CLI.

DISCLAIMER: I am not resposible for you breaking your save files, I just made the tool.

Patch Notes: v1.1
* added Tinker menu, allows for controlled access to your registry by you.
* added revive option in NPC config
* fixed a bug with a error on launch
* re-wrote all of the prompts to be cleaner
* added deletesave menu to delete your registry data
